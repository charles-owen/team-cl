# CourseLib Base Site component

For many years I have been developing software to support my course websites. 
I think I have made a really sophisticated tool for sites that can support
a wide range of different uses. I have decided it would be nice to
make this code open-source. However, it has been one big library. To make it
easier to develop and maintain and more flexible for users, I'm restructuring
it into components that can be installed as needed.
